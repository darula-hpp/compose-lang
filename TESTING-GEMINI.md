# Testing Gemini Integration 🧪

The Compose compiler is now ready to use Google Gemini!

## Quick Test

Run this command in your terminal (from the demo directory):

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyA7yzVAQSlsm6ucXsGid-QLwJFqoSFYu1E"
compose build
```

The build should now use **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to generate real code instead of mock templates!

## What to Expect

You'll see output like:
```
🔨 Building Compose project...
📋 Configuration: ./compose.json
🤖 LLM: gemini (gemini-1.5-pro)

📁 Found 1 .compose file(s):
   - todo-app.compose

⚙️  Compiling...
   ✓ todo-app.compose

🎨 Generating code...

   Target: frontend (react)
   Generated 5 file(s)  ← REAL CODE FROM GEMINI!
   ✓ Written to ./generated/frontend

✨ Build complete!
```

## Check the Generated Code

```bash
cat generated/frontend/components/TodoItem.js
```

You should see a fully implemented React component generated by Gemini, not just a template!

## Files Updated

- ✅ `compiler/emitter/gemini-client.js` - Model updated to `gemini-1.5-pro`
- ✅ `demo/compose.json` - Configured to use Gemini
- ✅ Gemini 1.5 Pro API ready to use

The API key you set should work. If you see "falling back to mock", the env variable isn't being passed. Try running the export and compose build in the same terminal session.
